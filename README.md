# CServe - Nginx Clone

CServe is a Nginx clone written in C. The primary purposes on building this application are:
- to build a strong, maintainable and testable system
- to understand how Nginx works
- to learn software design and architecture

>[!WARNING]
>This project is still in progress. I wiped out the 1st phase of the project (April - June) as it was messy and hard to maintain. I will re-write the project from scratch using modern tooling, best practices and design patterns which I'm learning from Nginx source code, books like Fluent C and 21st Century C, etc.

# Installation

Soon... But for now:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samandar-komil/cserve.git
cd cserve
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./build/cserve
```
